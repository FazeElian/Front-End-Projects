Hi everyone!

I hope that you can enjoy this project and learn how i made it, i created this project for fun and practice my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. Too i decided to use Bootstrap framework for support some section in the project with some styles and scripts there. About the design, i decided to change some thing that i thought that could looks better applying some styles changes. I got the design of mockup of Front-End Mentor, that is a web site where you can find some web pages design for practice.
